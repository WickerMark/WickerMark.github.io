    "text": "Introduction\nThe ability to generate prime numbers is important for a variety of tasks, most notably, cryptography, the RSA algorithm for instance, in psuedo-random number generation and benchmarking algorithms.\n\n\nSetting up the Problem\nNumpy will be used for the square root function later in the code.\nAn array used to store the prime numbers is created and the first two prime numbers are stored.\nNumber, the variable used to represent the current number to be checked if it is prime, is set to 3. This means that the counter, used to represent how many prime numbers have been found, is set to 2, since 3 is the second prime number.\n\nimport numpy as np\n\nprime_list = [2, 3]\nnumber = 3\ncounter = 2\n\nThe prime number to be generated can be set to anything, but for this example, I have used 1000. This means that the while loop will continue to iterate until the counter is no longer less than 1000.\n\n\nCalculating and Outputting the nth Prime Number\nThe variable number is first incremented by 2 (to emit all even numbers since these cannot be prime).\nA new variable, called prime, stores a boolean value which states if a number is prime or not. Initially, prime is set to True.\nA for loop is used to check if number is divisible by previous prime numbers.\nThe square root function is used here because if the index of the prime number to be checked is greater than the square root of the number, it is not a factor. If this statement is true, the code breaks out of the for loop.\nHere, I use the modulo operator to determine if the number has a remainder when dividing by previous prime numbers. If it does, the number is determined as a composite number, and so prime is set to False.\nThe final if statement is used such that if the number was determined to be prime, the counter would be incremented, and the number would be appended to the list of prime numbers so that future numbers can be checked against it.\nFinally, counter is cast as a string and concatenated to output the nth prime number.\n\nwhile counter &lt; 1000:\n    number += 2\n    prime = True\n    for i in prime_list:\n        if i &gt; np.sqrt(number):\n            break\n        elif number % i == 0:\n            prime = False\n            break\n    \n    if prime == True:\n        counter += 1\n        prime_list.append(number)\nprint(\"The\", str(counter) + \"th prime number is\", number)\n\nThe 1000th prime number is 7919"

    "title": "Root Finding using the Newton-Raphson Method",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nDeveloped in the 17th century by mathematicians Sir Isaac Newton and Joseph Raphson, the Newton-Raphson method is a powerful and efficient numerical technique for iterative root finding. It is based on the idea of linear approximation (tangent line approximation) and provides increasingly accurate estimates of the root. # Setting up the Problem The sympy library is used for symbolic differentiation. Numpy is used for the np.arange() function. Matplotlib is used to plot a graph to show the roots found.\n\nimport sympy as sp\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\nTo begin, we will define f(x) and f’(x) symbolically. Next, we will convert these equations to numerical functions using the function sp.lambdify() to enter values of x into the function and first derivative.\n\n# Defines x for sympy\nx = sp.Symbol('x')\n\n# Defines f(x)\nf = 2 * x**3 + 2 * x**2 - 10 * x - 8\n\n# Calculating the symbolic derivative using sympy and defining f'(x)\nderivative = sp.diff(f, x)\n\n# Convert symbolic function and derivative to numerical functions using lambdify\nf_lambdified = sp.lambdify(x, f)\nderivative_lambdified = sp.lambdify(x, derivative)\n\nNext, we must set the parameters of the iterative method. The first parameter is a range of initial approximations of the roots which will be refined iteratively by the algorithm to find a better approximation of the root. The next parameter is a limit to the number of iterations that can occur in the for loop to determine the roots. This is so prevent the risk of non-convergence (so the loop does not continue infinitely). For this example, I used 1000 iterations, however, this could be changed to the preference and specification of the user. The final parameter is the tolerance, a small number that will determine if the root determined by the method is close enough to 0 to be considered a root. I have used 1e-6, but again, in reality, the user would change this to their preference.\n\n# Other parameters for the Newton-Raphson Method\n# Define the range of initial guesses to find multiple roots\ninitial_guesses = np.linspace(-4, 4, 10)\n# Maximum iteration\nmax_iterations = 1000\n# Tolerance\ntolerance=1e-6\n\n\n\nNewton-Raphson Method\nFirst, the initial guess is set as the current approximation for the root. Then, \\(f(x_n)\\) and \\(f'(x_n)\\) are calculated. To ensure no divide by zero errors occur, the value of the derivative is checked. The equation \\(x_{n+1}=x_n-\\frac{f(x_n)}{f'(x_n)}\\) is used to update the approximation of the root. Finally, if \\(|{x_{n+1}-x_n}|&lt;tolerance\\), then the y coordinate of the approximation is close enough to 0 that the function return the value of x to prevent non-convergence. Otherwise, the ‘next’ approximation is set to the current approximation.\n\n# Defines the function for the Newton-Raphson Method\ndef newtonraphson(f, derivative, x_0, max_iterations, tolerance):\n    # Sets the starting x value\n    x_n = x_0\n    for i in range(max_iterations):\n        fx_n = f_lambdified(x_n)\n        dfx_n = derivative_lambdified(x_n)\n        \n        # Ensures the prevention of a divide by zero error\n        if dfx_n == 0: \n            print(\"Zero derivative encountered. No solution found.\")\n            return None\n        \n        # Uses the equation to find the next x coordinate\n        x_next = x_n - (fx_n / dfx_n)\n\n        # Check if the result is within the desired tolerance\n        if abs(x_next - x_n) &lt; tolerance:\n            return x_next\n        \n        # Updates x\n        x_n = x_next\n\n\n\nOutputs and Plotting\nAn empty array of x and y coordinates is created for the purpose of plotting the roots on a graph for visualisation. For every guess in the list of inital guesses, the function to perform the Newton-Raphson method is called and passed the current inital guess. The root is then rounded to 10 decimal places. This is a fairly arbitrary value, and the user could set this to whatever they wanted. The if statement is used to ensure that duplicate roots are not considered. The x coordinates of the roots found are printed and are also appended to the empty array created earlier. 0 is appended to the y coordinate.\n\n# Creates empty array of x coordinates to plot the roots\nrootx = []\nrooty = []\n\n# Finds multiple roots using different initial guesses\nfor x_0 in initial_guesses:\n    # Calls the function\n    rootx_n = (newtonraphson(f, derivative, x_0, max_iterations, tolerance))\n    rootx_n = round(rootx_n, 10)\n\n    # If statement to avoid duplicates and ignore None results\n    if rootx_n is not None and rootx_n not in rootx:\n        # Prints the x coordinate of each root\n        print(\"Root: x =\", rootx_n)\n\n        # Updates x and y coordinate of root in the arrays\n        rootx.append(rootx_n)\n        rooty.append(0)\n\nRoot: x = -2.3913823806\nRoot: x = -0.7728655578\nRoot: x = 2.1642479385\n\n\nThe results of the program are very accurate. The results match the correct x coordinate of the roots to the ninth decimal place, which demonstrates the reliability of the method.\nA list of x and y coordinates for f(x) are created in order to plot the graph. The scatter function is used to plot the roots.\nThen, the parameters of the plot are set: the limit for the x axis, the creation of a grid, a solid line for the x axis, and also the legend to display labels.\nLastly, the graph is then displayed.\n\n# Creates an array of x coordinates and finds corresponding y coordinates \n# for plotting\nx = np.linspace(-4, 4, 100)\ny = f_lambdified(x)\n\n# Plots the curves\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.scatter(rootx, rooty, marker=\"x\", color=\"red\", label=\"Roots\")\n\n# Sets parameters of the plot and plots the curves\nplt.xlim(-4, 4)\nplt.ylim(-15, 15)\n\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\nplt.axhline(y=0, color=\"black\")\n\nplt.show()"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nEuclid’s algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), that is the largest number that divides two positive integers without a remainder, was first described in the 7th book of Euclid’s Elements written c. 300 BC, making it one of the oldest algorithms.\nThe algorithm works by using the fact that the GCD of two numbers, a and b, is the same as the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b. In Python, this is achieved using the modulus function, or %. This process is then repeated until there is no remainder.\nThe Euclidean algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))).\nInterestingly, the extended Euclidian algorithm calculates the coefficients of Bézout’s identity such that \\(ax+by=gcd(a,b)\\). This is used in solving Diophantine equations and in modular arithmetic, for instance, the RSA encryption algorithm when calculating the modular inverses for key generation.\n\n\nInputs\nThe algorithm requires two inputs - two positive integers, a and b. Normally, the user would be asked to input these integers, however, for the purpose of this example, I have used the integers shown below.\n\n# Defining positive integers a and b\na = 2376\nb = 4832\n\n\n\nFunction to Perform Euclid’s Algorithm\nThe function consists of a while loop which only stops when the remainder is 0 (and therefore the algorithm has found the GCD). First, the remainder of a divided by b is calculated using the modulus (%) function. Then, b is set to a, and the remainder is set to b in order to repeat the algorithm until the GCD is found.\n\n# Function to perform the Euclidian algorithm\ndef gcd(a,b):\n    while b != 0:\n        remainder = a % b\n        a = b\n        b = remainder\n\n    return a\n\n\n\nOutput\nTo output the GCD, the program calls the function, passes the two integers a and b, and prints the result.\n\n# Outputs the GCD\nprint(\"The Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is\", gcd(a, b))\n\nThe Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) is 8"

    "text": "Introduction\nThe below code is my implementation of the first and second challenge of the BPhO Computational Challenge 2024. The objective was to create an exact analytical model of projectile motion without air resistance.\nDISCLAIMER: This is just a snippet of our submission for the competition, since the final product was an application 2800 lines of code in length. To see the two minute video submission detailing the entire solution with my partner watch the video here:  https://youtu.be/ViT6NdrrbJo .\n\n\nSetting up the Problem\nFirst, the plotting library matplotlib is imported, which will be used to plot the trajectory of the projectile. Also, numpy will be imported for its trigonometric and mathematical functions.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\n\nThe program takes inputs \\(\\theta\\), \\(u\\), \\(g\\) and \\(h\\). The commented out sections of code show how the user would be asked to input these. In this example, I have used \\(\\theta=37\\), \\(u=23.31\\), \\(g=9.81\\) and \\(h = 12.32\\). The angle entered in degrees is converted into radians for future use.\n\n# Enables the user to enter conditions for the trajectory\n# angle = float(input(\"Enter the angle of projection in degrees: \"))\nangle = 37\ntheta = (angle * np.pi) / 180\n\n# u = float(input(\"Enter the intitial velocity of the projectile: \"))\nu = 23.31\n\ng = 9.81\n\n# h = float(input(\"Enter the height above the ground of the projectile: \"))\nh = 12.32\n\nThis section of code prevents the user inputting an invalid height less than 0.\n\nif h &lt; 0:\n    print(\"ERROR Height must be greater than 0\")\n    exit()\n\nThe variables costheta and sintheta are created since they are used frequently in the program. Then, the velocity is resolved into horizontal and vertical components using the equations \\(u_x=u\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(u_y=u\\sin\\theta\\).\n\n# Resloves forces into horizontal and vertical component\ncostheta = np.cos(theta)\nsintheta = np.sin(theta)\n\nux = u * costheta\nuy = u * sintheta\n\n\n\nCalculating the Range\nNow, the program calculates the range of the projectile and outputs the calculated value. This is achieved using the equation \\(R=\\frac{u^2}{g}(\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta+\\cos\\theta\\sqrt{\\sin^2\\theta+\\frac{2gh}{u^2}})\\). The x_graph variable is used to determine the highest x coordinate displayed on the plot, which is determined from the range. This is purely aesthetic.\n\nR = (u**2 / g) * (sintheta * costheta + costheta * np.sqrt(sintheta**2 + (2 * g * h)/ (u**2)))\nprint(\"The range is\", round(R, 2), \"m\")\nx_graph = R + R * 0.1\n\nThe range is 66.36 m\n\n\n\n\nCalculating the Time of Flight\nThe time of flight is then calculated using the general time equation and the range. The equation for the time of flight at a given x coordinate is \\(t=\\frac{x}{u_x}\\) so the time of flight across the range is \\(T=\\frac{R}{u_x}\\). The calculated value is then output along with a phrase.\n\n#Time of flight calculation\ntflight = R / ux\nprint(\"The time of flight is\", round(tflight, 2), \"s\")  \n\nThe time of flight is 3.56 s\n\n\n\n\nComputing the Trajectory of the Drag-Free Projectile\nAn empty list of x and y coordinates are created. These will then be appended to when the position of the projectile is updated.\nA for loop with a timestep of 0.01s, updates the position of the projectile between 0s and the time of flight every 0.01s. The equations \\(x=u_xt\\) and \\(y=h+u_yt-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) are used to update the x and y coordinates respectively at a given time, \\(t\\).\n\n# Creates an empty arrary for the x and y coordinates of the trajectory\nx = []\ny = []\n\n# Plots the parabolic path of the projectile with a timestep of 0.01s and an interval of 10s\nfor i in np.arange(0, tflight, 0.01):\n    t = i\n    x.append(ux * t)\n    T = t * t\n    y.append(h + (uy * t) - (0.5 * g * T))\n    t += 1\n\n\n\nCalculating the Apogee\nThen, the x and y coordinates of the apogee are calculated using the equations \\(x_a=\\frac{u^2}{g}\\sin\\theta\\cos\\theta\\) and \\(y_a=h+\\frac{u^2}{2g}\\sin^2\\theta\\). The y_graph variable is used to determine the y limit of the graph, the highest y coordinate displayed. Finally, a phrase is created which outputs the coordinates of the apogee.\n\n# Apogee calculation\napx = u**2 / g * sintheta * costheta\n\napy = h + u**2 / (2 * g) * sintheta**2\ny_graph = apy + apy * 0.1\n\nprint(\"The apogee is at (\", round(apx, 2), \",\", round(apy, 2), \")\")\n\nThe apogee is at ( 26.62 , 22.35 )\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the Trajectory\nFor the last portion of code, the graph is plotted along with the coordinates of the apogee. The parameters of the graph are then set, including labels and limits, and then the graph is plotted.\n\nplt.plot(x, y)\nplt.scatter(apx, apy, marker=\"x\", color=\"red\")\n\nplt.xlabel(\"Displacement in x / m\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Displacement in y / m\")\nplt.ylim(0, y_graph)\nplt.xlim(0, x_graph)\nplt.show()"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Introduction\nDetailed in this blog post is the solution to the third challenge of the BPhO Computational Challenge 2024. The objective is to calculate the trajectories of three projectiles which are launched from (0, 0) and pass through fixed point (X, Y). One of these projectiles is the minimum launch velocity needed for the projectile to hit the chosen point, and the second and third are “low and high ball” trajectories, the highest and lowest possible angles the projectile can be launched at and still collide with the target coordinates based on the entered initial velocity.\nDISCLAIMER: This is just a snippet of our submission for the competition, since the final product was an application 2800 lines of code in length. To see the two minute video submission detailing the entire solution with my partner watch the video here:  https://youtu.be/ViT6NdrrbJo .\n\n\nSetting up the Problem\nFirst, the fundamental libraries are imported. Matplotlib for plotting, numpy for mathematical and trigonometric functions, math for trigonomatric functions (specifically arctan) and figure is imported from matplotlib to use the axes functions.\n\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport numpy as np\nimport math\nfrom matplotlib.figure import Figure \n\nNext, the conditions / parameters of the model are set. In the final GUI application submitted for the competition, these would be inputted using text input boxes. \\(g\\) would be set using a combobox containing popular celestial objects, such as the planets in our solar system, or using a text box to enter a custom value.\n\\(Y\\) is the y coordinate that is hit by the projectile and \\(X\\) is the x coordinate.\nFor the purpose of this demonstration of the algorithm, I have used the below values:\n\nX = 1000\nY = 300\nu = 150\ng = 9.81\n\nThe problem must be decomposed into three separate problems. The first problem is the minimum velocity projectile. There are equations which can be used to calculate the minimum velocity and the corresponding angle of projection for the model. The second and third problems consist of the low and high ball trajectories. These can also be computed using equations.\n\n\nMinimum Launch Velocity\nThe minimum launch velocity must be calculated. This is achieved using the equation \\(u_{min}=\\sqrt{g}\\sqrt{Y + \\sqrt{X^2 + Y^2}}\\).\nNow, the corresponding angle of projection must be calculated using \\(\\theta_{min}=\\tan^{-1}(\\frac{Y+\\sqrt{X^2+Y^2}}{X})\\).\nThen, the velocity of the projectile is resolved into its horizontal and vertial components using the equations \\(u_x^{min}=u_{min}\\cos(\\theta_{min})\\) and \\(u_y^{min}=u_{min}\\sin(\\theta_{min})\\).\nFinally, the time of flight is calculated with \\(T_{min}=\\frac{X}{u_x^{min}}\\).\n\nminu = np.sqrt(g) * (np.sqrt(Y + np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)))\nmintheta = math.atan((Y + np.sqrt(X**2 + Y**2)) / X)\nminux = minu * np.cos(mintheta)\nminuy = minu * np.sin(mintheta)\nmint = X / minux\n\nAn empty array of x and y coordinates for the minimum velocity trajectory are created. These will be appended to in the for loop. A timestep of 0.01s is used to calculate the position of the projectile between the instant the projectile is launched and the time of flight. The equations \\(x_{min}=u_x^{min}t\\) and \\(y_{min}=u_y^{min}t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) are used to update the x and y coordinates of the projectile between each timestep.\n\nx = []\ny = []\n\nfor i in np.arange(0, mint, 0.01):\n    t = i\n    x.append(minux * t)\n    T = t**2\n    y.append((minuy * t) - (0.5 * g * T))\n\n\n\nLow and High Ball Trajectories\nThe angle of projection for the low and high ball trajectories is determined using the following equations: \\(\\theta_{\\pm}=\\frac{-b\\pm\\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}\\), where \\(a=\\frac{g}{2u^2}X^2\\), \\(b=-X\\) and \\(c=Y+\\frac{gX^2}{2u^2}\\).\n\na = (g / (2 * u**2)) * X**2\nb =  -X\nc = Y + ((g * X**2)/(2 * u**2))\nlow_theta = math.atan((- b - np.sqrt(b**2 - (4 * a * c)))/(2 * a))\nhigh_theta = math.atan((- b + np.sqrt(b**2 - (4 * a * c)))/(2 * a))\n\nThe velocity is resolved into its horizontal and vertical components and the time of flight for the low ball trajectory is calculated using the equations \\(u_x^{-}=u\\cos(\\theta_{-})\\), \\(u_y^{-}=u\\sin(\\theta_{-})\\) and \\(T_{-}=\\frac{X}{u_x^{-}}\\) respectively.\n\nlow_ux = u * np.cos(low_theta)\nlow_uy = u * np.sin(low_theta)\nlow_tflight = X / low_ux\n\nAgain, a for loop is used to calculate the x and y coordiantes of the projectile with a timestep of 0.01s between the instant the projectile is launched and the time of flight. Empty arrays of x and y coordinates are created and appended to using the equations: \\(x_{-}=u_x^{-}t\\) for x coordiantes and \\(y_{-}=u_y^{-}t-\\frac{1}{2}gt^2\\) for y coordinates.\n\nlow_x = []\nlow_y = []\n\nfor low_i in np.arange(0, low_tflight, 0.01):\n    low_t = low_i\n    low_x.append(low_ux * low_t)\n    low_y.append((low_uy * low_t) - (0.5 * g * low_t**2))\n\nThis process is then repeated for the high ball trajectory.\n\nhigh_ux = u * np.cos(high_theta)\nhigh_uy = u * np.sin(high_theta)\nhigh_tflight = X / high_ux\n\nhigh_x = []\nhigh_y = []\n\nfor high_i in np.arange(0, high_tflight, 0.01):\n    high_t = high_i\n    high_x.append(high_ux * high_t)\n    high_y.append((high_uy * high_t) - (0.5 * g * high_t**2))\n\n\n\nPlotting the Trajectories\nFirst, a figure of subplots is created to use the ax functions.\nThe three trajectories are then plotted, along with the marker showing the user’s chosen coordinate.\nFinally, the parametrs of the plot are set, including labels for the axes, limits for the axes and labels for each of the trajectories.\n\nfig, ax = plt.subplots()\n\nax.plot(x, y, label=\"Minimum u\")\nax.plot(low_x, low_y, label=\"Low Ball\")\nax.plot(high_x, high_y, label=\"High Ball\")\nax.scatter(X, Y, marker=\"x\", color=\"red\")\n\nax.set_xlabel(\"Displacement in x / m\")\nax.set_ylabel(\"Displacement in y / m\")\nax.set_ylim(0)\nax.set_xlim(0, X)\n\nax.legend()"

I have set the small step to \\(\\epsilon=1\\times10^{-8}\\), however, this can be modified to the specification of the user.\n\n\nSetting up the Problem\nTo begin the algorithm, the required libraries are imported, specifically numpy for trigonometric and logarithmic functions and matplotlib for the plotting.\nNext, the function to be differentiated is defined. For the purpose of this example, the function used is \\(f(x)=\\ln(x^2)\\sin(x)\\). The user can change the function to whatever may be required.\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Creates the function\ndef f(x):\n    return np.log(x**2) * np.sin(x)\n\n\n\nCalculating the Derivative\nThis function finds the derivative using the central difference method and a small step, ϵ, at a given x coordinate. This is useful for plotting, because the desired array of x coordinates can be passed to the function to generate an f’(x) function for that set of values. For other algorithms, the gradient descent algorithm for instance, finding the derivative at a given x coordinate is useful for further calculations.\n\n# Function to differentiate\ndef derivative(f, x):\n    eps = 1e-8\n    der = (f(x + eps) - f(x - eps)) / (2 * eps)\n    \n    return der\n\n\n\nOutputting a Graph of the Derivative\nHere, np.linspace(-15, 15, 500) is used to create an equally spaced array of 500 x coordinates between x = -15 and x = 15. Then, for each x coordinate, a corresponding y coordinate is found by passing each x coordinate into the function.\n\n# Creates an array of x coordinates and finds corresponding y coordinates \n# for plotting\nx = np.linspace(-15, 15, 500)\ny = f(x)\n\nNow, list comprehension is used to apply the derivative function to each element \\(x_i\\) in \\(x\\). The result is then stored as a numpy array for plotting.\n\n# Differentiates x coordinates to create the graph of the first derivative\ndydx = np.array([derivative(f, xi) for xi in x])\n\nLastly, the curves f(x) and f’(x) are plotted and given appropriate labels.\nThen, the parameters of the plot are set, the limit for the x axis, the creation of a grid and also the legend to display labels.\nThis graph is then displayed.\n\n# Plots the curves\nplt.plot(x, y, label=\"f(x)\")\nplt.plot(x, dydx, label=\"f'(x)\")\n\n# Sets parameters of the plot and plots the curves\nplt.xlim(-15, 15)\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis algorithm has been curated for use in the gradient descent algorithm, which will be a future post."

    "text": "Introduction\nThe objective of this blog post is to create an implementation of a one-dimensional gradient descent algorithm used for optimisation in machine learning where a function needs to be minimised. Shown below is the code and explanations of my implementation of the algorithm.\n\n\nSetting up the Problem\nFirst, the required libraries are imported and the function f(x) is defined for future use. This can be changed to any function that the user would require. In this example, I have used the equation \\(f(x)=x\\sin(x)+\\cos(x)+x\\).\n\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n\n# Creates the function\ndef f(x):\n    return x * np.sin(x) + (np.cos(x) + x)\n\n\n\nCalculating the Derivative\nThis function calculates the numerical derivative using the central difference method and a small step ϵ. This is defined by the equation \\(f'(x)\\approx\\frac{f(x + \\epsilon)-f(x - \\epsilon)}{2\\epsilon}\\). For a more detailed analysis of this function, check out my previous post here:  Calculating the Numerical Derivative using the Central Difference Method .\n\n# Function to differentiate\ndef derivative(f, x):\n    eps = 1e-8\n    der = (f(x + eps) - f(x - eps)) / (2 * eps)\n    \n    return der\n\n\n\nCreating the Gradient Descent Algorithm Function\nThe following function performs the gradient descent algorithm. There are two stopping conditions for the algorithm, a maximum number of iterations, and if the absolute value of the gradient is lower than a set threshold value. The variable alpha is the learning rate of the algorithm, a scalar quantity which controls the size of the steps the algorithm takes. The equation \\(\\theta_{t+1}=\\theta_t-\\alpha\\nabla_{\\theta}f(\\theta_t)\\) is used to update the position of the marker until the minimum point is found.\n\n# Function to perform the gradient descent algorithm\ndef descent(f, derivative, xk, alpha=1e-3, tol=1e-4, max_iters=10000):\n    for i in range(max_iters):\n        grad = derivative(f, xk)\n        if abs(grad) &lt; tol:\n            break\n        xk = xk - alpha * grad\n\n    return xk\n\n\n\nFinding Minima\nThe algorithm is then ran from various different starting points until the lowest minima is found. Empty lits of x and y coordinates are created and appended to with the coordinates determined by the algorithm. In this example, I used starting points between -12 and 12. The y coordinate of the optimal minimum point is then determined and printed.\n\nxk_points = []\nyk_points = []\nfor i in np.arange(-12,12):\n    # Starting position\n    xk = i\n    # Finds the x coordinate of each minima\n    xk = descent(f, derivative, xk)\n    xk_points.append(xk)\n\n    # Finds the y coordinate of the minima for plotting\n    yk = f(xk)\n    yk_points.append(yk)\n\n# Prints the y coordiante of the optimal minimum\nprint(\"The optimal minimum has y coordinate\", min(yk_points))\n\nThe optimal minimum has y coordinate -22.036404343345218\n\n\n\n\nPlotting the Function, Derivative and Minima\nThe below code generates the function, its derivative and the minima found by the algorithm.\n\n# Creates an array of x coordinates and finds corresponding y coordinates \n# for plotting\nx = np.linspace(-15, 15, 100)\ny = f(x)\n\n# Differentiates x coordinates to create the graph of the first derivative\ndydx = np.array([derivative(f, xi) for xi in x])\n\n# Plots the curves\nplt.plot(x, y, label=\"f(x)\")\nplt.plot(x, dydx, label=\"f'(x)\")\nplt.scatter(xk_points, yk_points, marker=\"x\", color=\"red\", label=\"Minima\")\n\n# Sets parameters of the plot and plots the curves\nplt.xlim(-15, 15)\nplt.grid()\nplt.legend()\n\nplt.show()"
