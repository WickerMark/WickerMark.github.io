# Introduction
Euclid's algorithm to find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD), that is the largest number that divides two positive integers without a remainder, was first described in the 7th book of Euclid's <i>Elements</i> written c. 300 BC, making it one of the oldest algorithms.

The algorithm works by using the fact that the GCD of two numbers, a and b, is the same as the GCD of b and the remainder of a divided by b. In Python, this is achieved using the modulus function, or %. This process is then repeated until there is no remainder.

The Euclidean algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))).

Interestingly, the extended Euclidian algorithm calculates the coefficients of BÃ©zout's identity such that $ax+by=gcd(a,b)$. This is used in solving Diophantine equations and in modular arithmetic, for instance, the RSA encryption algorithm when calculating the modular inverses for key generation.

# Inputs
The algorithm requires two inputs - two positive integers, a and b. Normally, the user would be asked to input these integers, however, for the purpose of this example, I have used the integers shown below.
```{python}
a = 2376
b = 4832
```
# Function to Perform Euclid's Algorithm
The function consists of a while loop which only stops when the remainder is 0 (and therefore the algorithm has found the GCD). First, the remainder of a divided by b is calculated using the modulus (%) function. Then, b is set to a, and the remainder is set to b in order to repeat the algorithm until the GCD is found.
```{python}
def gcd(a,b):
    while b != 0:
        remainder = a % b
        a = b
        b = remainder

    return a
```
# Output
To output the GCD, the program calls the function, passes the two integers a and b, and prints the result.
```{python}
print(gcd(a, b))
```
